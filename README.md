<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
This is a JAVA APP named **Segment Tree üå≥ Visualizer**. This app shows the building visualization of a Segment Tree through animation for functions like Sum, Max, Min, and Xor. I have also added a query feature that accepts `l` and `r` integer values (indices between which the query has to be processed, 0-based index). The animation shows how the query works on the Segment Tree, and the highlighted nodes at the end of the query indicate which nodes are part of the answer (based on the query type, i.e., min, max, sum, xor).

### Visualizing Segment Tree Operations
- **Create** a Segment Tree from an array of numbers.
- **Query** the tree for operations such as sum, max, min, or XOR between indices `l` and `r`.
- **Update** specific elements in the tree and see how it affects the overall tree structure.
- **Animate** each operation to help users visually understand how the tree works.

## üöÄ Features
- **Visualization of Segment Tree construction** through animations for operations like Sum, Max, Min, and XOR.
- **Query functionality** to find sums, max, min, or xor of a given range of indices (0-based).
- **Update functionality** that allows users to modify values in the tree and see the change in real-time.
- **Animated operations** that highlight nodes involved in the query result.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack
- **Backend:** Java, Spring Boot
- **Build Tool:** Maven
- **API Testing:** Postman
- **Frontend (Optional):** Can be integrated with a frontend of your choice for visualization.
