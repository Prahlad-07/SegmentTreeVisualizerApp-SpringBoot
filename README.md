## About The Project

Welcome to the **Segment Tree üå≥ Visualizer**! This **Java-based application** enables you to **visualize, query, and animate** the construction of a Segment Tree for different operations such as Sum, Max, Min, and XOR.

With **real-time animations** and a **query feature**, this app helps users to interactively explore how Segment Trees work. You can visualize operations by querying specific index ranges and see how nodes are updated and highlighted, giving you a clear understanding of the underlying structure.

### Features
- **Segment Tree Construction Visualization**: Watch as your array turns into a segment tree.
- **Querying**: Perform range queries like sum, max, min, and xor between indices `l` and `r`.
- **Updates**: Modify specific elements in the tree and see the effects in real-time.
- **Animated Operations**: Each operation is animated, making it easy to follow the process.

### Visualizing Segment Tree Operations
- **Build**: From an array of numbers, a Segment Tree is constructed.
- **Query**: Get the sum, max, min, or XOR for a range `[l, r]` of indices.
- **Update**: Modify elements in the tree and immediately see the updates.
- **Animation**: Observe the tree as nodes are updated, queried, or altered.
